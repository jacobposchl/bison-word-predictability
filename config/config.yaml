# Configuration file for code-switching predictability analysis

# Data settings
data:
  # Path to directory containing EAF files
  # Update this to point to your data directory
  path: "./raw_data"

# Processing settings
processing:
  # Minimum number of words required to keep a sentence
  # Sentences with fewer words will be filtered out
  min_sentence_words: 2
  
  # Time gap threshold (in milliseconds) for grouping annotations into sentences
  # Consecutive annotations within this time gap will be merged into one sentence
  # Default: 1000ms (1 second)
  time_gap_threshold_ms: 3000

# Translation settings
translation:
  # OpenAI model to use for translation
  model: "gpt-4"
  
  # Whether to use caching for translations
  use_cache: true
  
  # Directory for translation cache
  cache_dir: "cache/translations"
  
  # Temperature for translation (0.0-1.0, lower = more consistent)
  temperature: 0.3
  
  # Maximum tokens for translation response
  max_tokens: 200

# Output settings
output:
  # Base directory for all results
