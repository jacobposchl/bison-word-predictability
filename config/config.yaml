# Translation settings
translation:
  # NLLB model settings (free, local translation)
  model: "facebook/nllb-200-3.3B" 
  # Options:

  # Parallel processing settings
  parallel:
    # Number of CPU cores to leave free. If null, uses all available cores (leaves 0 free).

    # Example: On an 8-core system, num_workers=2 means use 6 workers, leaving 2 cores free.

  # Batch processing settings
  # Number of sentences per batch. If null, processes all sentences at once.
