# Configuration file for code-switching predictability analysis

# Data settings
data:
  # Path to directory containing EAF files
  # Update this to point to your data directory
  path: "./raw_data"

# Processing settings
processing:
  # Time buffer in milliseconds for sentence overlap detection
  # This accounts for slight timing inconsistencies in annotations

# Translation settings
translation:
  # OpenAI model to use for translation
  model: "gpt-4"
  
  # Whether to use caching for translations

  # Directory for translation cache
  cache_dir: "cache/translations"
  
  # Temperature for translation (0.0-1.0, lower = more consistent)
