# Configuration file for code-switching predictability analysis

# Data settings
data:
  # Path to directory containing EAF files
  # Update this to point to your data directory
  path: "./raw_data"

# Processing settings
processing:
  # Minimum number of words required to keep a sentence
  # Sentences with fewer words will be filtered out

# Translation settings
translation:
  # NLLB model settings (free, local translation)
  model: "facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M"  # Options: 600M (faster), 1.3B, 3.3B (better)
  device: "auto"  # "auto" (detect GPU/CPU), "cpu", or "cuda"
  
  # Whether to use caching for translations
  use_cache: true
  
  # Directory for translation cache

# Analysis settings
analysis:
  # Minimum number of Cantonese words required at sentence start
  # for inclusion in analysis dataset
